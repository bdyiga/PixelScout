# ImgClassify
This is a system that classifies images into categories (e.g., animals, vehicles, objects) using a convolutional neural network (CNN).

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document describes the design of an enhanced Image Classification System using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify images into predefined categories, with added functionality for model persistence and custom image classification.

### 1.2 Scope
The system classifies images from the CIFAR-10 dataset and allows for classification of user-provided images. It includes model training, saving, loading, and evaluation capabilities.

### 1.3 Objectives
- Build a CNN model to classify images with high accuracy
- Provide functionality to save and load trained models
- Allow classification of both CIFAR-10 and custom images
- Visualize the training process and results

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 High-Level Architecture
The system follows an enhanced machine learning pipeline:
1. Data Loading and Preprocessing
2. Model Definition
3. Model Training or Loading
4. Model Evaluation
5. Prediction Interface for CIFAR-10 and Custom Images

### 2.2 Components
1. **Data Loader**: Loads and preprocesses the CIFAR-10 dataset
2. **CNN Model**: Defines the architecture of the neural network
3. **Training Module**: Handles the training process of the model
4. **Model Persistence**: Saves and loads trained models
5. **Evaluation Module**: Assesses the performance of the trained model

7. **Visualization Module**: Generates plots for training history and sample predictions

## 3. Detailed Design

### 3.1 Data Loader
- Function: `load_and_preprocess_data()`
- Utilizes `cifar10.load_data()` from Keras datasets
- Normalizes pixel values to range [0, 1]
- Performs one-hot encoding on labels

### 3.2 CNN Model
- Function: `build_model()`
- Architecture:
  1. Conv2D layer (32 filters, 3x3 kernel, ReLU activation)
  2. MaxPooling2D layer (2x2 pool size)
  3. Conv2D layer (64 filters, 3x3 kernel, ReLU activation)
  4. MaxPooling2D layer (2x2 pool size)
  5. Conv2D layer (64 filters, 3x3 kernel, ReLU activation)
  6. Flatten layer
  7. Dense layer (64 units, ReLU activation)
  8. Dropout layer (50% dropout rate)
  9. Dense layer (10 units, softmax activation)

### 3.3 Training Module
- Function: `train_or_load_model()`
- Uses Adam optimizer
- Categorical crossentropy loss function
- Trains for 20 epochs with batch size of 64
- Uses 20% of training data for validation
- Saves the trained model to a file

### 3.4 Model Persistence
- Saves trained model to 'cifar10_model.h5'
- Loads pre-trained model if available

### 3.5 Evaluation Module
- Function: `evaluate_model()`
- Evaluates model on test set
- Reports test accuracy

### 3.6 Prediction Module
- Functions: `predict_image()`, `classify_custom_image()`
- Handles both CIFAR-10 and custom images
- Preprocesses custom images to match CIFAR-10 format
- Returns predicted class and confidence

### 3.7 Visualization Module
- Function: `plot_history()`
- Plots training and validation accuracy over epochs
- Plots training and validation loss over epochs

## 4. Data Flow

1. CIFAR-10 data → Data Loader → Preprocessed data
2. Preprocessed data → Training Module → Trained Model
3. Trained Model ↔ Model Persistence
4. Trained Model → Evaluation Module → Performance Metrics
5. CIFAR-10 Image / Custom Image → Prediction Module → Predicted Class

## 5. User Interface

The system uses a command-line interface. Key interactions include:
- Automatic model training or loading
- Display of model performance metrics
- Visualization of training history
- Classification of a sample CIFAR-10 image
- Classification of user-provided custom images

## 6. Performance Considerations

- Model architecture balances accuracy and computational efficiency
- Dropout is used to prevent overfitting
- Pre-trained model loading improves subsequent run times

## 7. Security Considerations

- The system does not handle sensitive data
- For deployment, consider implementing user authentication and data validation

## 8. Testing Strategy

- Use of validation set during training to monitor overfitting
- Evaluation on separate test set for unbiased performance estimation
- Manual testing of prediction function with sample and custom images

## 9. Deployment

The current system runs locally. For production:
- Consider containerization (e.g., Docker) for easy deployment
- Implement a web service (e.g., using Flask or FastAPI) for remote access

## 10. Maintenance and Support

- Regular updates to dependencies (TensorFlow, NumPy, Matplotlib, Pillow)
- Periodic retraining on new data if available
- Monitoring of system performance in production environment

## 11. Future Improvements

1. Implement data augmentation for improved model robustness
2. Explore transfer learning with pre-trained models (e.g., VGG16, ResNet)
3. Develop a user-friendly GUI for image upload and classification
4. Extend the system to handle larger and more diverse datasets
5. Implement model explainability techniques (e.g., Grad-CAM) for interpretability
6. Add support for real-time image classification from camera input

## 12. Conclusion

This updated Image Classification System provides a robust foundation for image classification tasks. It demonstrates the use of CNNs for image classification, incorporates model persistence for efficiency, and allows for the classification of both CIFAR-10 and custom images. The modular design facilitates future enhancements and extensions to the system.
